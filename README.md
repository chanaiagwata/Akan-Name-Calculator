## Overall Project Description
<p>This is a web tool that takes a user's birthdate, calculates what day of the week they were born, and then displays their Akan Name based on their gender. The origins of Akan names may be traced back to Ghanian culture. In Ghana, children are frequently given their first name as a 'day name,' which corresponds to the day of the week on which they were born. Here are some Ghanian names for the days of the week.</p>
